* What's this?

Material for a clojure presentation with 4clojure.com as a support.

The final picture is in =build/prez.png=, please [[https://github.com/denlab/clj-pres/raw/master/4clojure-oriented-prez/build/prez.png][check it]] before
anything else.

The final image is intended to be viewed with [[prezi.com]], it will allow
to build a path of the viewing of the image in advance (zooming,
dezooming, ...).

To get an idea of what it could look like, check [[http://prezi.com/kdsbpq1t8dm8/jenkins-cleanup-2/][a previous presentation of mine]]
. It was done exacly
with the same process than this presentation: 
- All authoring in done in yEd
- And then build the view path in prezi 

* How to use the sources? 

In order to edit the doc, you need: 

- [[http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html][yEd]]

- Install yEd, launch it.

- Import the custom palette in it: =src/prez.clj.yed.palette.graphml=.

- Then open =src/prez.graphml=, you should be able to edit it.

* Notes

- Please note that there is a image diffing functionality in github,
  that allow to check the difference between versions of an image. We
  should use it! It means committing and pushing the final image
  (yes committing a binary: bad! :) to be able to github's diff it.

* Stuff to do  [0%]

** TODO primitive types: show analogy with Java

We can use a slide of a presentation by Stuart Halloway (clojure java
interop or something like that).

It shows a matrix of the primitive type of clojure/java

** TODO the prez should be in english

it's in french/english (frenglish?) now :)

** TODO build the path with prezi, and then export it to an exec (will be usefull if there is a network failure)

** TODO better present clojure atlas

- Have a real scenaria that will demonstrate the power of clojure Atlas

  - "Oh, I need to search for this functionnality on list"

  - "Let's check list"

  - "Ho no, it's not a List that I want, it's a vector", or something
    like that

- It could be integrated in the realisation of a of 4clojure exercice

- Because otherwise it is not obvious that clojure Atlas is really usefull


** TODO better present clojure docs

See comment for clojure atlas

** TODO Create a github page with all the links that will be shown in the prez

We could even use this repo

** TODO Prepare a google spreadsheet to store the name of the 4clojure participant

That way we will be able to show to everyone during the subscription
phase, and everybody will be able to follow everybody easilyer
