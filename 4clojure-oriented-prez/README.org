* What's this?

Material for a clojure presentation with 4clojure.com as a support.

The final picture is in =build/prez.png=, please [[https://github.com/denlab/clj-pres/raw/master/4clojure-oriented-prez/build/prez.png][check it]] before
anything else.

The final image is intended to be viewed with [[prezi.com]], it will allow
to build a path of the viewing of the image in advance (zooming,
dezooming, ...).

To get an idea of what it could look like, check [[http://prezi.com/kdsbpq1t8dm8/jenkins-cleanup-2/][a previous presentation of mine]]
. It was done exacly
with the same process than this presentation: 
- All authoring in done in yEd
- And then build the view path in prezi 

* How to use the sources? 

In order to edit the doc, you need: 

- [[http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html][yEd]]

- Install yEd, launch it.

- Import the custom palette in it: =src/prez.clj.yed.palette.graphml=.

- Then open =src/prez.graphml=, you should be able to edit it.

* Notes

- Please note that there is a image diffing functionality in github,
  that allow to check the difference between versions of an image. We
  should use it! It means committing and pushing the final image
  (yes committing a binary: bad! :) to be able to github's diff it.

* Stuff to do  [0%]

** TODO primitive types: show analogy with Java

We can use a slide of a presentation by Stuart Halloway (clojure java
interop or something like that).

It shows a matrix of the primitive type of clojure/java

** TODO the prez should be in english

it's in french/english (frenglish?) now :)

** TODO build the path with prezi, and then export it to an exec (will be usefull if there is a network failure)
