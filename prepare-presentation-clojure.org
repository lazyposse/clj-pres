* What we're craving for?
In our everyday developer life
- simplicity / no incidental complexity
- rapidity
- clarity
- feedback
- fail-fast
*** Simplicity
- KISS
- Concentrate on the pb to solve, no incidental complexity that hides the true pb
*** Rapidity
- We do have lots of stuffs to solve, the faster, the merrier
- No fighting with something out of scope
*** Clarity
- Be able to read code from anyone
- Simplicity is intertwined here
*** Feedback
- Want
  + Know the fastest possible what's wrong
  + Unit Testing frameworks (midje, clojure.test)

- Do not want
  - launch some improbable command to know that
  - setup an heavy environment to do that
    - wait for the CI server to feed us
*** Failfast
- REPL
* Why Clojure ?
- addresses these problematics because it was created for that.
(Are we there yet? - Rich Hikey)

* IDE
*** emacs
*** plugin eclise? intellij? - Do not know any as emacs is sufficient
